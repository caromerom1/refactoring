# Problem 7

This project is a system to calculate the shipping cost of a package from point A to point B. To calculate the cost, it performs the calculation taking into account the user's membership (which can be Gold, Silver, or non-member), the weight of the package, whether it is fragile or not, and the distance between two points on Earth using the Haversine formula.
